# Prime Pizza Parlor

Welcome to Prime Pizza Parlor! This is a web application designed to facilitate the ordering of pizzas online. Customers can browse through a selection of pizzas, view their descriptions and prices, and add them to their cart for checkout.

The pizzas they selected will stay in the cart while they go through the rest of the ordering process, filling out their Customer Information.  After filling out their info, the customer will be brought to the Checkout page, where they will see an overview of their order before submitting. Once they submit their order, the data combined into a single object and sent to the database.  When it is submitted, the user is brought back to the home page to view the pizzas, and the cart is emptied. 

## Features

- **Browse Pizzas**: Users can browse through a variety of pizzas available in the shop.
- **View Pizza Details**: Users can view detailed information about each pizza, including its name, description, and price.

- **Remove from Cart**: Users can remove pizzas from their cart if they change their mind.
